Description: MORE is a method which facilitate the task of applying regression models to multi-omic data. The goal of MORE is to model gene expression as a function of experimental variables, such as treatment, and the potential regulators of a given gene. MORE has a several functionalities to filter regulators: variable selection (Lasso, ridge regression and ElasticNet), filter for regulators with low variation, for missing data, for correlated regulators and stepwise methods.
